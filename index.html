      <h1>Your website should be so simple, a grad student could use it.</h1>
      <h1>You can't test that. I'll do it for you.</h1>

      <p>I'll get very drunk, sign up for grad school, and then review your website. I'll send you my screencast; you'll get a video of me, as a new user, and as a designer trying to keep it together. And you'll get a video the morning after (more or less) - so I can recap what I might have messed up when drunk and trying to envision my live as a xenobotanist, and apologize.</p>

      <p>I am a UX professional and full stack developer. I've been doing this for a long time. Here is my <a class='website' href="https://burntfen.com">website</a>, my <a class='website' href="https://github.com/RichardLitt">github</a>, and my <a class='website' href="https://twitter.com/richlitt">twitter</a>.</p>
      <p>One of the core tenets of UX is that you've got to design like "the user has no fucks left to give." I can't think of a better example of this than a grad student. Any feature of your site has to be able to be used by someone who could be a grad student - because, invariably, the user will mess it up otherwise. Wonderful idea. The thing is, it is hard to test.</p>
      <p> I and a lot of beer and poor exam results will test this for you.</p>

      <p class='intern'>I also review websites from a UX perspective while drunk, sober, and with my mom. If you're interested in that, <a href="mailto:richard@theuserisagradstudent.com">get in touch</a>.</p>

      <p class='intern'><i>Think of me like a user, but with a large knowledgebase on best practices, and no legal liability for your company. Actually, speaking of liability: I will ensure that I learn responsibly.  I take all blame if I accidentally do. I will ensure that I do not endanger anyone else in the process. You waive all responsibility for me upon payment. If you are concerned about me, please contact me. If you or your loved ones struggles with grad school, talk to your doctor. Various types of therapy with real trained and certified therapists have good success rates backed by actual scientific evidence, as do certain prescription drugs. Combining them likely has an even better success rate. Learn responsibly. </i></p>
